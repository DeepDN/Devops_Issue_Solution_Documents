- go to remote server to check log
- To check the SSH key types allowed on the server, you can look at the SSH server configuration file located at **`/etc/ssh/sshd_config`**

```bash
sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

```

- Once you have opened the file, look for the **`PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms`** line. This line lists the key types that are accepted by the SSH server.
- If the **`ssh-rsa`** key type is not listed, then that could be the reason for the error you are seeing. In that case, you can add it to the list of accepted key types.
- To do this, add the following line to the **`sshd_config`** file:

```bash
PubkeyAcceptedAlgorithms ssh-rsa
sudo systemctl restart sshd
```
